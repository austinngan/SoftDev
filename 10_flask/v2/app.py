from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__) #create instance of class Flask

@app.route("/")       #assign fxn to route
def hello_world():
    print("about to print __name__...")
    print(__name__)   #where will this go?
    return "No hablo queso!"

app.run()

# Whenever someone goes to the address, it will print:
# about to print __name__...
# __main__
# into the terminal.
# The page will also still show "No hablo queso!" in the browser.
#
# Worked as predicted.
