-- Predictions:
When we go to localhost:5000, the web browser will display:
"No hablo queso!" but in the terminal, it will print out:
"the __name__ of this module is..." and "__main__".

If we go to localhost:5000/static/foo, it will display the
contents of the /static/foo file.

If we go to localhost:5000/static/foo.html, the browser will
parse the html and display "Is this plaintext, though?".

-- Observations:
For localhost:5000 and localhost:5000/static/foo.html, our
predictions were correct.

For localhost:5000/static/foo, however, it differed from our
expectations, and instead it tries to open the file and asks
to save the foo file.
