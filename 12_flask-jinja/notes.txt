K12 -- Flask Templates
2021-10-07

-- Predictions/Notes:
Q0: Removing the render_template from the import will make
the test_templt function break, because render_template
wouldn't be defined.

Q1: We CONFIDENTLY predict the url to load the page will be:
"http://localhost:5000/my_foist_template"

Q2: The first parameter is the filename for the template.
The named parameters "foo" and "collection" will be used
as variables in the template file, so the {{ foo }} in
the template will be replaced with "fooooo" and the
{% for item in collection %} will use the list [0,1,1,2,3,5,8]
in place of collection.

Notes:
The model_tmplt.html file has some interesting syntax like
{% for item in collection %} which is reminiscent of python's
for loop, and {% endfor %} which could be assumed to signify
the end of the for loop block.

-- Observations:
Our predictions were correct.
