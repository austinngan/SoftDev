K16: All About Database
2021-10-24

- In sqlite3 shell commands interacting with the database must end with a semicolon
- Adding a TEXT value into the database has to be in string format (with quotations around it)
- "INSERT INTO roster VALUES (?)", (<?>)
  - the ? within the string in the parentheses acts as a variable.
  - the <?> is the value you want to add to the database and goes outside the string.
  - https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html
- f Strings
  - f"{ var }"
  - var has to be defined outside of the string
  - Allows you to add TEXT values into the database through python (as it needs to be in string formatting)
