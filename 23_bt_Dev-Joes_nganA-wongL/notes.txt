DISCO
Based on the tutorial, we noticed that Bootstrap had a lot more stylistic options. For example, the carousel CSS styling was a lot easier to implement in Bootstrap. We also discovered how to manipulate text with tags like <code> and and Bootstrap styles like text-primary. We also implemented Accordian Drop Downs, which was something we didn't add in Foundation.

We also gained some insights on the differences between Foundation and Bootstrap. Bootstrap has a lot more styling, but also has a lot more CSS content. Foundation had more of a simple, easy to read code but it seemed to have less styling options.

QCC
One thing we implemented in Foundation that was difficult to implement in Bootstrap was a row and column format in regards to the cards. It would be interesting to see if there were effective ways to do that, as the Foundation method is very clear.

Q0
We consulted the tutorial given to us by Rachel and Wenhao. We specifically looked at their code and comments that they included.

Q1
We prefer Foundation mostly because of its responsive menu. It was incredibly easy to create content that fit a lot of screens because of the row column format. Furthermore, we felt foundation formatted text on different sized screens a lot better. However, we did really like the Bootstrap styling.
