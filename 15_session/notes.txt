Dev Console:
We noticed some errors that didn't really matter? (favicon error when requesting)

TO DO:
make new templates depending on if username/password is incorrect
finish conditional checks
probably need to use request.cookies.get('username") to establish a session if the user is logged in/has logged in previously
comments!
note more dev console stuff
